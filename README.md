# Scripting Exercices

Below is a data mining and scripting exercise. Note that we will use it to evaluate primarily : 
 1. problem solving skills,
 1. data science / machine learning skills,
 1. programming skills.
<br></br>

**To Do :**
1. Follow the instructions below while maintaining a presentable script. Ideally we ask that you make your script available as a repo on your own github account. 
1. Send us the link to your work when you are done.
1. Over the next step of the interview, we will ask that you present your work (assumptions, challenges, data exploration, preprocessing, training, assessment, results & discussion).
We encourage you to present the results using a **notebook**. At the very least, you should ensure that your results are presentable. 
<br></br>

**Remember :**
1. Make sure to **apply best practices** as you move through the examples. (data preparation, preprocessing, engineering, model selection & evaluation)
1. **Think outside of the box**. Do not satisfy yourself with a *basic data science recipe* . The power of a data scientist is to figure out a way to transform messy data into valuable insights. 
1. **Make assumptions** where necessary, we are interested in your approach primarily.
1. **Leave footprints of your thought process** : What did you try? What worked/did not work? 
1. **A good story is as important as an algorithm**. We expect you to be able to communicate and present your ideas, methodology and implementations. 

**Good Luck!**

## Exercise 1.  Crime Dataset
The Crime Dataset contains **socio-economic features** from the US 1990 Census. The target is the crime rate per community.

Ref. : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/communities/communities.names

Using the **crime_prep.csv** file :
1. Explore your data.
1. Prepare your data (preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, ...)
1. Attempt to predict the crime rate, comparing performance, and identifing the best model.
<br></br>
<br></br>

## Exercise 2 : Fraudulent Transactions
The file **fraud_prep.csv** contains credit card transactions. 
1. Explore your data.
1. Prepare your data (preprocessing, feature engineering, feature selection, dimensionality reduction, feature learning, ...)
1. Attempt to predict fraudulent transactions, comparing performance, and identifing the best model.
<br></br>
<br></br>

**BONUS Point :** Can you think of methods other than **classification** to accomplish this task?
